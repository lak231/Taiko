# Taiko Drum Master with LeapMotion

### How to install Taiko Drum Master
1. You will need to have a PS2 emulator to run the Taiko game. 
I recommend using PCSX2: https://pcsx2.net/
2. After installing the emulator, you might need a PS2 bios to run the emulator, which can be found here: https://www.loveroms.com/extras/ps2-bios.php
3. Lastly, you will need the ROM of the game to run it on the emulator, which can be found here: https://www.loveroms.com/download/playstation-2/taiko-drum-master/145719

### How to play the game with LeapMotion
1. _Run the Java code in Admin mode._ This is an important step.
2. Run your emulator. 
    * If you are using PCSX2, go to CDVD > Iso selector > locate the ROM that you downloaded. 
    * Then, go to Config > Controllers > Plugin Settings > go to the Pad 1 tab > map the L1 button to the key 2 on your keyboard, L2 to 1, R1 to 3, and R2 to 4. You can use a different key mapping by changing the ```robot.keyPress``` in the ```template.java``` file.
    * Finally, go to System > Boot CDVD (full) or Boot CDVD (fast) if you want to skip the default loading screen. 
3. Keep both of your hands face down above the sensor. Imagine there is a drum in front of you and there are four parts that you can hit: inner left, inner right, outer left and outer right. The two inner parts are for the red circles in the game and the outer parts the blue ones.
